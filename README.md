# Machine Learning Content-Based Filter for Tourist Attraction Planner
This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning content-based filter designed to assist in planning tourist attractions based on a user's budget. The system aims to recommend tourist attractions that align with the user's budget constraints, ensuring an optimized and personalized travel experience.

## Overview
In this project, we have developed a content-based filtering algorithm that leverages machine learning techniques to recommend tourist attractions to users based on their specified budget. The algorithm analyzes various features, such as entrance fees, accommodation costs, transportation expenses, and more, to determine the suitability of attractions within the given budget range.

### Features
- User input: The system allows users to specify their budget range for their trip.
- Data collection: We have collected a comprehensive dataset containing information about various tourist attractions, including entrance fees, accommodation costs, and transportation details.
- Data preprocessing: The collected data is preprocessed to ensure consistency and handle missing values.
Feature extraction: Relevant features are extracted from the dataset to form a basis for comparison and recommendation.
- Machine learning model: A content-based filtering algorithm is implemented using machine learning techniques to train a model that can recommend attractions based on budget constraints.
- Recommendation Algorithm: The trained model is used to generate personalized recommendations for users based on their specified budget range using Knapsack Problem.
